# Weather-App-SheCodesPlus

//This repository is for a Vanilla JS project completed for SheCodes (Plus). It is a weather app that uses the 
Open Weather API to utilize a functional search bar with a button to use the user's current location.
It also displays accurate celsuis or fahrenheit information, icons, and forecast of the following hours of the day.
The background is a quarnetined woman, like me! Made during the the Corona-virus quarentine, Summer of 2020.
